# BEHAVIOUR OF APPLICATION (FOR TDD TESTING APPROACH)

- Print on standard output the score of a given Cribbage hand (String)
- Compute the score of a Cribbage hand
    - Distinguish hand cards from starter card
    - Know the rank and suit of a card
    - Combination of cards
- Parse a Cribbage hand represented as a string
    - Each rank corresponds to a numeric value
    - Well defined set of values for rank and suit

# TESTS

- "5♥5♦5♠J♣5♣" -> print "29"
- "0♦J♥Q♠A♣9♦" -> "4"
- 0♦J♥Q♠A♣9♦ -> score is 29 -> this test need implementation ALMOST on every rule
- 0♦J♥Q♠A♣9♦ -> score is 4 (run on four) -> good test for "run of four" code

1st possible test (cause there is no much code)
- "5♥5♦5♠J♣5♣" -> four hand cards(five of Hearts,...) and a starter card(five of Clubs)
    - "5♥5♦5♠J♣5♣" -> recognizing that the five of Clubs is the starter card
    - "5♥5♦5♠J♣5♣" -> the hand cards are ...
even simpler test: (recognizing a single card)
- "5♥" -> card with rank 5
- "5♥" -> card with suit of Hearts
- "5♦" -> card with suit of Diamonds
and so on..
